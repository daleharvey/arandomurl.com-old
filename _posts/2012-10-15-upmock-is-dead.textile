Every once in a while I try to design things, I have never been particularly good at it but I still regard design as a passion. While I dont pretend that bad tools are the reason I am not a designer I always felt that they could be much better tooling for web designers.

Jason Santa Maria "explained these problems":http://v4.jasonsantamaria.com/articles/a-real-web-design-application/ much better than I could, to sumarise my complaints though:

 * Graphic design tools like Photoshop don't render true to the browser, don't integrate with existing web content and dont have tools aimed towards designing for the web.
 * Dreamweaver and other WYSIWG tools lack the graphical capabilities for designing websites.

So on a rainy afternoon(quite common here in Scotland) I started building "UpMock":http://upmock.com. My aim was to build an open source tool capable of producing high fidelity static website mockups. The focus on static websites was important for me, I have seen many projects before this quickly redirect their attention to outputting publishable website. While I do think WYSIWG publishing should exist, building a tool that outputs usable code (without infinite resources) almost certainly means cutting corners when it comes to providing the power and flexibility on the graphical editing side of things. I wanted to solve the problem of producing designs, not code.

After a few weeks coding I ended up producing something I was quite happy with as a prototype, I had also left my job in the meantime and was seriously considering turning UpMock into my next startup venture. However before I could do anything about it I had been offered a dream job, and while I still think UpMock could have turned into a really succesful project, the chance to work on Boot2Gecko excited me much more.

UpMock currently has some pretty nice features:

 * Editable 960gs style grid
 * Snapping to grid + elements
 * Keyboard shortcuts (matching Photoshops in places)
 * Google Webfont integration
 * HTML elements (forms)
 * Colour picker + Gradient editor

One of the reasons I love open source is that when an author leaves a project the project can live on. If you would like to use UpMock as a base it has always been on "Github":https://github.com/daleharvey/upmock.

I have been keeping tabs on other projects doing similiar things, if anyone has any to add to this list then please do, as yet I am still waiting for that killer web design tool but some of these have promise:

 * "Easel":https://www.easel.io/demo - Really well done, nice implementation of editing styles, still lacking graphical capabilities.
 * "Stylo":http://styloapp.com/ - Similiar in functionality to UpMock, more polished UI
 * "Picozu":http://www.picozu.com/editor - More graphically powerful but found extremely hard to use
 * "Typecast":http://beta.typecastapp.com/ - Focussed pretty much entirely on Type, really nice

P.S Gradient editing is broken in chrome, I have no idea why. Hat tip to anyone who figures it out :)
