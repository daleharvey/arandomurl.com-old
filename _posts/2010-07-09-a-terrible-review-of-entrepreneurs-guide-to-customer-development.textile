I tried writing a long indepth review of this book, but it (my review) was boring and full of fluff, so you get this instead.

For those not familiar with Customer Development, it is basically test driven development applied to a business. It teaches you how to test your business propositions from imagination all the way up to profitability and beyond. Young technical founders are constantly advised that their startup will not live or die by the features they code but Customer Development was the first explanation that really made me understand why that is true.

The Entrepreneur's Guide to Customer Development(CustDev) by Brant Cooper and Patrick Vlaskovits is the follow up to 4 steps to the Epiphany(4steps) by Steve Blank. 4steps is a great book that kicked off the recent focus towards Customer Development, however it can be a fairly dry and due to its background in enterprise sales has a lot of content that isnt relevant to the current crop of web 2.0 startups that are learning from it.

CustDev is an attempt to distill the key points from 4steps into an easily manageable 80 pages of colourful, practical and relevant advice, a goal it manages very well. However in its attempt to trim 280 pages of long paragraph after long paragraph a lot of Steve Blanks insight and advice were lost, in particular the set of worksheets in the appendix to 4steps were sorely missed. 

If you are working on a startup, you should buy both Entrepreneur's Guide to Customer Development and 4 Steps to the Epiphany, if it went to a battle to the death then 4steps would win, but CustDev is cheap and is a brilliant introduction to the Customer Development process which is then extremely thouroughly dissected in 4steps.
